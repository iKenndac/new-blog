<p>Unfortunately, my office is located in a very small mobile phone signal blackspot as it's nestled at the bottom of a small hill — move a few metres away outside and signal returns to normal. Recently, Vodafone released a little device called the <a href="http://online.vodafone.co.uk/dispatch/Portal/appmanager/vodafone/wrp?_nfpb=true&amp;_pageLabel=templateCClamp&amp;pageID=PPP_0161">Sure Signal</a> — a mini cell tower (femtocell) that provides your phone with signal.</p>
<p>Pretty much <a href="http://www.pocket-lint.com/review/4620/vodafone-sure-signal-femtocell-box">anywhere</a> you see a Sure Signal review, you'll see comments talking about Vodafone's evil plans for ripping off the consumer by charging extra to supply their service over the customer's internet connection. Well, I managed to use a SUPER SECRET method to get my Sure Signal absolutely free.</p>
<ol>
<li>First, I didn't bitch and complain about it on some internet forum.</li>
<li>Next, I phoned Vodafone's customer services and explained my situation, pointing out that it's a bit crappy that I can't use my phone at work. </li>
<li>There's no step three!</li>
</ol>
<p>At no point did I have to argue or get annoyed. The guy I spoke to in customer services was incredibly helpful and sympathetic to my problem. Less than 24 hours later, I have full 3G signal in my office.</p>
<p>I'm sharing this SUPER SECRET information with you, the casual surfer, so you might be able to get a Sure Signal for free as well.</p>
