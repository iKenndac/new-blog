A while ago, I posed [an article](/blog/2010/12/analysing-a-touch-to-desktop-ui-port-using-fitts-law-reeder/)
discussing Reeder's UI, and how it doesn't really fit in with a desktop
environment. That post got a lot of attention, and some people got
really angry with me and misquoted me and sent hysterical emails and so
on.

I still stand by the points made in that post, and the people mentioned
above seemed to think that I hated the whole app - which is untrue. I
still don't really like many parts of the UI, but it's still a beautiful
reading experience provided you memorise what all the unlabelled buttons
do.

Go [buy it](http://reederapp.com/mac/) — I did!
