I put a gallery of my favourite photos online. They're not favourites because of the significance of the events in them, but simply because of the photo itself. That's why there's a photo of a leaf in there. Every photograph but one was taken by me - the one that wasn't has me in it. 

You can visit the gallery <a href="http://ikennd.ac/galleries/favourite-photos/">here</a>.

Here's a random selection: 

<table with="100%" border="0" cellspacing="10" cellpadding="0" align="center">
<tr><td><img src="http://ikennd.ac/galleries/favourite-photos/thumbnails/thumb-1.jpg"/></td><td><img src="http://ikennd.ac/galleries/favourite-photos/thumbnails/thumb-4.jpg"/></td></tr>
<tr><td><img src="http://ikennd.ac/galleries/favourite-photos/thumbnails/thumb-17.jpg"/></td><td><img src="http://ikennd.ac/galleries/favourite-photos/thumbnails/thumb-11.jpg"/></td></tr>
