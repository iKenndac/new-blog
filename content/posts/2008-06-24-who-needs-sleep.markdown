Perhaps the most gruelling part of my job is when the workload starts to pile up. Being at the top of the chain, as it were, means I can't complain to my manager when I get too much pressure put on me - I just have to man it up and put the work in. So, for the next few weeks I'll be working 12 hour days. <em>Fun.</em>

Still, we persevere. At least when this is all over I'll have a new product out the door (money++) and be in a nice big new house (money––) Then, I can take a week off work to sleep it all off.
