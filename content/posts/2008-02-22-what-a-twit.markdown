I've noticed people using <a href="http://twitter.com/">Twitter</a> before, and I've finally caved in and decided to try it. For those of you who don't know, Twitter is like the "Current status" thingy on Facebook, except you don't have to sign in to Facebook and faff around to use it. It seems quite fun just to let people who care know what you're doing, and the 99% who don't can just ignore it. 

You can follow people, too, and reply to what they're saying. You can follow my Twitter feed <a href="http://twitter.com/ikenndac">here</a>, or just look at the top of the sidebar to the left - my five most recent tweets are there.
