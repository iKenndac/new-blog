I own a nice <a href="/pictures/desk/finished.jpg">computer system</a> with a <a href="http://www.wacom-europe.com/uk/products/intuos/intuos3_a5.asp">Wacom Intuos 3</a> graphics tablet, which is pretty sweet. Part of my computer's software collection is a fantastic piece of art software called <a href="http://www.corel.com/painterix/home/index.html">Painter</a>. So, what do I do with this? Draw stupid stuff, that's what!

Ok, so years ago in school my friend Marcus and I invented "Turbosausages", which are sausages with wheels and rocket boosters that little people drove about. Last year, when I was bored in a lecture at University, I remembered about them and drew a <a href="/turbo/">few</a>.

I now present Turbosausages 2: In Colour!
