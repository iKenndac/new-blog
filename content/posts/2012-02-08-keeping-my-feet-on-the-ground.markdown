A few weeks ago, my friend came to visit me from the UK. He's quite the photography enthusiast, and while he was here he fell in love with my [Canon EF 24-105mm f/4 L](http://www.the-digital-picture.com/Reviews/Canon-EF-24-105mm-f-4-L-IS-USM-Lens-Review.aspx) lens. By the time we left for our road trip to the UK, he'd already ordered a similar lens and very kindly *gave* his Canon EF-S 17-85mm lens to my fiancé since his new one would be replacing it.

Two days after we arrive in the UK, the lens my friend gave us stuck at 17mm and wouldn't budge. I felt super-bad about this, even though it turned out it was a [common problem](http://thydzik.com/canon-efs-17-85mm-is-stucklocked-zoom-repairdisassembly/) with this lens.

Still feeling bad about breaking my friend's lens, I dived right into the tutorial and tried to fix it! Lenses are incredibly intricate, and my first attempt wasn't so successful - I'd fixed the zoom sticking, but now the focus didn't work!

### Take Two ###

Tonight, I tried to fix it again, and was successful! The lens' zoom is a smooth as ever and the focus works too. I was ecstatic, and I looked down to see my dog staring at me with glee, raising his paw as if to say "HIGH FIVE bro, you tha man!"

A couple of seconds later I realised he was *actually* trying to say "Damnit I'm hungry - give me food!" Still pleased with my dexterity and skill, I went to the kitchen to distribute food for him and ended up with, well, a less than optimal result.

I guess there's no brain surgery in my future after all.
