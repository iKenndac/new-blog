<h3>9:30am</h3>
<p>"Ha! Suckers!" I thought, ambling into work at 9:30, pleased at being almost on time for work for once. I'd queued up at silly-o'clock once before, for the launch of the iPhone 3G two years ago. It hadn't gone well — my store ran out of iPhones before I got to the front of the queue and I wasn't that far back at all.</p>
<p>For the iPhone 4, I pre-ordered for delivery instead. I sat at work <a href="http://twitter.com/iKenndac/status/16881412096">smugly</a> <a href="http://twitter.com/iKenndac/status/16925130048">tweeting</a> about not having to queue. You can set your watch by the UPS van here — if your watch is only accurate to 15-minutes, at least — so I was confident I'd have my iPhone by 4pm.</p>
<p>Refresh refresh refresh. Online tracking assured me my parcel was out for delivery. Refresh. Out for delivery.</p>
<h3>4pm</h3>
<p>No UPS truck. I phoned UPS.</p>
<p>"The iPhone rollout is causing delays today," the friendly lady offered. "Your van is probably just running late — they'll be running until 7pm."</p>
<p>Time passed. I called again a few times. Each time, same answer.</p>
<p>My repeated attempts at getting answers had got the UPS call centre to put an "urgent resolution request" or some such to my local depot. They'd call me back!</p>
<p>Refresh. Out for delivery.</p>
<h3>7pm</h3>
<p>They didn't call me back. I phoned the call centre again — as soon as the computer answers, star-zero-zero to get to a human. "Your request is due to be resolved by 8pm." Annoyed, I decided to go home.</p>
<p>Refresh. Out for delivery.</p>
<h3>7:01pm</h3>
<p>The phone rang between the office door and the car. "Hi, this is someone from the Luton UPS depot" said someone who probably actually had a name. "I've been looking for your parcel, and it's actually here at the depot."</p>
<p>RAAAAGE.</p>
<p>"It's been here all day, actually." I heard her brace for a barrage of abuse.</p>
<p>Stay calm. Calm calm calm.</p>
<p>"Can I come and collect it now? Normally UPS won't let me collect unless you've tried to deliver at least once."</p>
<p>"That is <em>normally</em> the case, but since this is our fault I can make an exception."</p>
<p>Damn right you'll make an exception, I thought but didn't say since it probably wasn't her fault. Determined to not waste half of another day, I set off for Luton.</p>
<h3>7:40pm</h3>
<p>"If you could just write your address here, I'll go and find your parcel."</p>
<p>*Writes*</p>
<p>"Daniel, right? I think I spoke to you on the phone earlier. I know exactly where your parcel is — I'll be back in a minute.</p>
<h3>7:42pm</h3>
<p>"Sign here, please."</p>
<p>*Signs*</p>
<p>She hands over the parcel. <em>Triumph!</em></p>
<p>"So, what happened? How can a package be scanned in as on the truck, but not actually be on the truck?"</p>
<p>"I'm not sure — I think the driver for your area was off today."</p>
<p>"Oh, so there's a big pile of stuff for my route back there?"</p>
<p>"No, only one or two things actually."</p>
<p>I saw the panic spread across her face as her <em>web of lies</em> started to untangle.</p>
<p>"I'll be sure to pass this on to our supervisor to be properly investigated. The exit is just over there — press the white button to open the door."</p>
<h3>7:50pm</h3>
<p>Mmmmm, Pizza Hut. What wasted day? Hmmm, I wonder....</p>
<p>Refresh. Poor Android phone, so diligently tracking its replacement. "19:01: The package was missed at the UPS facility. UPS will deliver on the next business day."</p>
<p>Sigh.</p>
<h3>9:10pm</h3>
<p>The lines marking where I'm supposed to cut my SIM down into a microSIM go through some of the metal contacts on the chip. That's fine, right?</p>
<h3>9:13pm</h3>
<p>"Your iPhone is now unlocked."</p>
<p><em>Bliss.</em></p>
