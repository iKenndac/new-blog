Since my <a href="/blog/2009/06/the-devolution-of-communication/">last</a> display of how <em>bad</em> our communication can be, I thought that I could try harder to not pipe random crap through the SMS app. Unfortunately, that meant most of the messages sent between us were either teasing one another or, again, status updates — hopefully with better grammar, though.
