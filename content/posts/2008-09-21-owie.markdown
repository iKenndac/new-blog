I've been doing some bike riding since moving house, and I'm lucky to be situated within riding distance of <a href="http://www.chicksandsbikepark.co.uk/">Chick Sands</a>. However, while watching someone else and assuming that if I followed their path I wouldn't crash, I... well, crashed. Artist's impression:
