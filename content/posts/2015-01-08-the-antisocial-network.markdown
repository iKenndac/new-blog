I have a love-hate relationship with Facebook. I opened my first account after my girlfriend 
(since fiancée, now wife) wanted to tag me in stuff she did. I survived maybe a couple of years
before getting bored and deleting my account.

I opened a new account in 2010 to organise a leaving party when we moved to Sweden. I've kept that
account to this day.

Starting on a positive note, I enjoy that 99% of my friends are on Facebook since it makes
organising events super easy. Their Messenger app isn't that bad either.

However, my Facebook timeline is absolute trash. I wrote about it a little in my
[Mental Health](http://ikennd.ac/blog/2014/09/mental-health/) post last year, and it's summed
up beautifully in the short (~2:30) film
[What's on your mind?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxVZYiJKl1Y), but the lives I'm seeing in
tiny, out of context snippets through my Facebook timeline are completely false. Hell, I'm guilty
of it myself. 

The thing is, I *know* the people in my Facebook timeline are nice people. Sure, I unsubscribed
from some friends long ago since they were just spewing out nothing but "funny" pictures and
**KEEP CALM AND _____ ON** slogans, but by-and-large my friends are lovely people. I wouldn't be
friends with them otherwise!

Recently it was getting to the point where I was starting to dislike people I *know* I really like,
even childhood friends I've known for decades.

"Why don't you just unfollow them?", my wife asked. 

So I did. I unfollowed every single person I'm friends with. My Facebook timeline is now completely
empty.

The obvious question is "Why don't you just delete your account?". Well, since 99% of my friends
are on there, I can still chat with them directly and organise events with them, and Facebook is a
decent tool for that.

I'm hoping that not receiving a constant stream of tiny snippets will make me think "I wonder what
*x* is up to these days?" sometimes, ending up contacting that person "properly" via some sort of
two-way direct chat (IM/phone/whatever). I haven't spoken to some of these people for over a year,
but Facebook has tricked me into thinking that we're in contact because I see their face on a
timeline once in a while, and they see my face in theirs.

Somehow, a social network has made me an unsocial friend.
