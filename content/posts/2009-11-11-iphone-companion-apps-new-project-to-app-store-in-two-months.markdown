Normally, I write a "Postmortem" <a href="http://www.kennettnet.co.uk/blog/comments/clarus-1.0-postmortem/">blog</a> <a href="http://www.kennettnet.co.uk/blog/comments/music_rescue_4.0_postmortem/">post</a> after each product I ship. However, recently I got the chance to give a talk at <a href="http://cocoaheads.org/uk/Swindon/index.html">CocoaHeads Swindon</a>, and chose to talk about my trials and tribulations when writing <a href="http://itunes.com/app/Clarus">Clarus for iPhone</a> (iTunes Link). The other day it struck me that this actually turned out to be a great postmortem, so instead of writing a blog post I sat at my computer and recorded a video of my slides and commentary. 

The talk goes through many aspects of designing and building an iPhone companion app, from design to implementation gotchas to non-coding issues such as whether you should even bother with an app, how much it costs to do, and so on.
