<p>In the week we came to Stockholm in 2009, the thing that most amazed me, and the thing I told everyone about when I got home, was the underground trains.</p>
<p>Compared to the London Tube, the Stockholm Tunnelbana is in another league. It's clean. It's smooth. It's quiet. <em>MY PHONE WORKS UNDERGROUND.</em></p>
<p>Everyone else here looked at my excited, hyper reaction with confusion. And, why not? Here, a smooth, quiet train where you can sit comfortably and use your phone is how things <em>should</em> be. It's how it should be in the UK, too.</p>
<p>In my opinion, these two trains are a great way of showing the differences between my experiences with the communication and public travel infrastructures in the two countries. Pay particular attention to the audio — they were both recorded by the same camera, set to the same volume setting. The audio has been boosted in iMovie, but by the same amount on both videos.</p>

<p>Second, a Stockholm Tunnelbana train travelling smoothly between stations:</p>

<p>See what I mean?</p>
