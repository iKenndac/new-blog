Well, I did it earlier than expected, but today I released my first open source code - iPhoneBrowser. I haven't advertised the fact it's there yet, and you can't even get to it from anywhere else on the site (yay web design!)... but its available <a href="http://www.kennettnet.co.uk/code/iphone/">here</a>.
