To all my friends and family,

<img src="/pictures/for_posts/2009/04/birthday.png" alt="Birthday Cake" title="Birthday Cake" width="32" height="32" class="alignright size-full wp-image-311" />
{:.center .no-border}

Due to work commitments, I'm officially postponing my birthday until Saturday, 18th April. Please refrain from lavish gift giving until that date. 

Thank you for your time,

-- Daniel
