A while ago, I [publicly announced](http://ikennd.ac/blog/2012/03/public-shaming-the-only-way/) that I was going to get my ass into gear and get fit enough to go snowboarding next winter. I'm happy to say that after ten weeks (*ish*), I'm now stronger, fitter, much better at recovering after tough hill climbs on my bike and… exactly that same weight as before. Perhaps celebrating a bike ride with a steak each time isn't the right approach.

This wasn't the original plan — I was going to get a FitBit and use the Personal Trainer feature to slowly build up the amount of walking and exercise I do to improve fitness. I did get a FitBit and while I really enjoy having it, my use for it now is simply to motivate me to walk where before I might take the lift or an escalator.

What's happened is that a side-note in my original blog post ("*…as well as trying my hardest to cycle more.*") has become a rekindled love of mine — I'm cycling multiple times a week and am having a ton of fun doing it, almost to the point where I forgot about the original plan to go snowboarding!

## Tips: Cycling For Fun ##

### Bike ###

Try to match your bike to your terrain as much as you can. Or, rather — match where you ride to the bike you have. Mountain bikes do have more versatility in that you can ride one on the road much better than you can ride a road bike on forest trails, though. A few tips if you're looking to buy a bike:

* Spend as much money as you can.

* Don't get a full-suspension bike that costs less than £1,000/$1,500. There's no hard-and-fast rule, but every full-suspension bike I've seen for less than £1,000 has suffered for simply not having the budget available for decent components (the rear shock absorber on my bike retails for about £300 and is considered "middle of the range"). The result is "pedal bob" — a lot the work you put into pedalling ends up bouncing you up and down on the suspension instead of propelling you forwards.

* Often, top-end components in one category are better than bottom-end components in the next category up. Cable disc brakes vs. hydraulic disc brakes, mechanically sprung forks vs. air sprung forks, etc.

* Make sure your bike is properly set up for your size and weight, including tyre pressures, suspension setup, etc.

* Find a *good* local bike shop to help you, and you'll be rewarded in spades. See my [recent story](http://ikennd.ac/blog/2012/05/the-bike-shop-the-birthday-and-the-averted-disaster/) about my fiancée's birthday for a good example.

* Most importantly: **DO NOT BABY YOUR BIKE**. Good bikes are *rewarding* when they take a pounding, get stupidly muddy and wet, etc. Plus, "So, I made it all the way to the bottom of the trail only to have my brakes not work right away because they were so covered in mud — I was squeezing so hard on the brakes that when the pads cleaned the discs they locked and I went right over the handlebars!" is a *much* more awesome story than "I went slowly, but at least my bike was clean!"

### Clothing ###

Cycling can be a literal pain in the ass — I wear a pair of padded lycra cycling shorts every single time I go out on my bike, and a skintight base layer on top to control heat and sweat. Since I'm well aware nobody wants to see a guy of my figure in stuff like that, I wear a pair of baggy shorts and a t-shirt over the top.

In addition, make sure you have a decent pair of gloves and a comfy helmet.

### Equipment ###

I cycle with a decent backpack that has an "air circulating" back — there's a plastic board in the pack that keeps it away from your back, resulting in a much less sweaty time. Inside that backpack I have:

* A CamelBak holding 1.5-2 litres of water for continual refreshment.
* A bike multi-tool.
* A spare inner tube. 
* A puncture repair kit.
* A bike lock.
* A pump.

On longer journeys, or trips away from home, I also add:

* A spare chain.
* More inner tubes.

Also, my bike has a decent light (Light & Motion Seca 700) and a water bottle permanently attached, as well as my GPS, bell, etc.

### Base Route ###

I have a 10km loop that I can do without feeling too tired. Over the past few weeks I've gotten faster and less tired around it, and it's great to see my gradual improvement over time.

### Data ###

These posts are going in a category called "A Nerd Outdoors" for a reason! I now have a [Garmin Montana](http://www.garmin.com/montana) strapped to my bike's handlebars, which is linked to a cadence sensor for keeping track of how fast I'm pedalling.

[<img src="http://pcdn.500px.net/7738070/9825b53711f1b925af9f0a20f1fd835c1962002c/4.jpg" />](http://500px.com/photo/7738070) \\

The Montana is perhaps overkill for this use, and you can get cheaper devices — even ones specifically designed for bike use — if you're not interested in all of the features the Montana has. 

Once I have this data, I upload it to [Strava](http://wwww.strava.com/), an *excellent* online service for keeping track of cycling which lets me compare how I'm doing with my friends and see my progress and statistics. For example, since April I:

* Have cycled 202km.
* Am averaging 37km/week.
* Am averaging 2 hours, 30 minutes on the bike a week.

This is an example or a recent ride of mine:

### Maps ###

I've already written [at length](http://ikennd.ac/blog/2012/04/high-tech-meets-low-tech-gps/) about the advantages of having decent maps for hiking/cycling, but one more use has cropped up: Quite often I'll be cycling along and see a path disappearing off into a forest and I'll think "That looks fun, I wonder where that goes?". Now I make a mental note of where it starts, and once I get home I can look on the map and see if I can fit it into my next ride.

This has already come up trumps — one of my favourite sections of trail in the area was found with this method. The entrance to it is a tiny, root-covered path with a "No horses" sign on it, but it opens out to a fantastically fun, fast, and sweeping section of trail that you can see me on a bit further up the page.

### Move To Sweden ###

Well, this last one might be a bit far-fetched, but *man* is it awesome for cycling here. I live 13km from the centre of the capital city, and I have a nature reserve full of lakes and awesome cycling trails right on my doorstep. A typical rest stop looks like this:

I guess I should get back out there!
