"Policy" is a bit of a strong word for a personal blog, but hey, it fits.

Everything on this website that's written in my voice (i.e., I'm not quoting someone or something else) has been done so without the use of generative AI (ChatGPT, Gemini, Copilot, etc) at any point in the process.

While these are undeniably impressive tools, I strongly dislike how they take the humanity out of language and it's important to me that the words I present here are *actually* mine. My words, my nuances, my mistakes. I am human, after all.

I greatly value the writing process — to the point where on occasion a post here will start out on paper — and machine-generated content simply isn't compatible with that value.

Content that's *not* written in my voice (i.e., quotes/content from other people/websites) isn't typically vetted for the use of AI tools.
